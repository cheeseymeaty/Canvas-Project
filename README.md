## How To Start & Load a Project
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To load a project, type the following command into the terminal: `npm run app --project=name`
(Replace `name` with a project in `./build/javascripts` excluding the "`.js`" file extension).
For example, executing `npm run app --project='boilerplate'` will make a localhost server of the `boilerplate.js` file.
After the server is done compiling, go to the `http://localhost:8080/build/` to see the project.

## Info & Stuff
- This repository first started on December 3rd, 2018 (2018/12/3).
- The lists of projects are in a folder which you can find all at `./build/javascripts`.
- You can read each of the projects' descriptions and infos on it by going into the localhost's console (F12) or through the JS files.
- I'm a **hobbyist**. Please, don't hurt me.
